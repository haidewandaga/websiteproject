       <p><h4><strong>WHY PROTECT</strong></h4></p>
       <p>Endangered Species... So What?</p>
       <p>We know that animal species have appeared and disappeared continually since life began on Earth. This is a natural phenomenon. However, species have been vanishing at a much faster rate for about a century now thanks to human factors such as pollution, commercial overexploitation, poaching and deforestation. Well, so what? Is it really that important to protect every species of animal on our planet?</p>
       <p>Certain philosophers and scientists keep repeating that if we don't save the animals, how will we be able to save ourselves? A better knowledge and understanding of animals gives us a better understanding of our own species. The will to protect animals and nature in general demonstrates the value of a society. And if the optimal development of our resources is a priority, it must be achieved not only economically or socially, but environmentally as well. This is the vision of sustainable development, which dictates that we use our natural resources wisely for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.</p>

       <img src="baby.png" class="img-circle" alt="Gorilla family" width="160" height="160">
       <p>Gorillas are the largest members of the primate family and are closely related to humans, with 98% of their DNA identical to that of humans. Unlike other primates they are terrestrial, meaning they do not climb trees and are land dwelling, inhabiting the tropical rainforests of central Africa. Historically the gorilla has been portrayed as a vicious killer; however they are shy gentle creatures that would not attack humans unless provoked.</p> 
       <p>Gorillas are classified as mammals, which is defined by the Oxford English dictionary as a ‘Warm-blooded vertebrate animal that has hair or fur, secretes milk, and (typically) bears live young’ (0ED 2010). Upon their discovery gorillas were classified as one species, however they are now separated into two species and four sub species according to geographical location and physical characteristics. They live in groups called a troop lead by a dominant silverback male, and are highly sociable animals, maintaining strong bonds between group members.</p>
        <p>In the wild their only predators are leopards, which can attack vulnerable youngsters and the biggest threat to gorillas is man. In recent decades gorilla populations have been affected by habitat loss, disease and poaching. Subsequently all gorilla species are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Due to the vast dense areas in which they live it is difficult to monitor and protect gorilla populations and therefore difficult to implement successful conservation techniques. However conservation efforts persist and several governmental and non governmental organizations named 2009 the ‘Year of the Gorilla’ with the aim of working together to further improve gorilla conservation. </p>
