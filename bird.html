     <h3>What is a <strong>Bird</strong>?</h3>
       <p>Birds are vertebrates (animals with backbone) with wings and feathers. Most birds can fly, using powerful muscles to flap their wings. But a few bird species do not have strong wings to fly, and so these birds are flightless. Bird's bodies 
         are covered with a light, tough layer of feathers and they have very light skeletons. Instead of teeth, they have horn-like beaks, or bills. Birds hatch from eggs, and many species build nests where there eggs and young can develop safely.</p>
       <p>Birds are found all across the world, and come in all shapes, colours and sizes. A bird can fly higher, further and faster than any other animal. Their front limbs take the form of wings to lift them into the skies. Their bodies are covered in feathers
       to help them fly easily, and also to keep them warm. But not all birds can fly. Some species live entirely on the ground and some spen much of their time on water. Birds are warm-blooded animals and reproduce by laying eggs.</p>
       <p>Birds have a furcula, a bone that is also known as the 'wishbone'. The furcula is a bone located in the bird's chest that prevents compression of the chest cavity during the downstroke of a wingbeat.</p>
       <p>All birds are classified as members of the Kindom Animalia, Phylum Chordata and Class <a href="mailto: balintagshielat@gmail.com">Aves.</a></p>
     <h4 id="lowpa"><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></h4>
        <p>The key characteristics of birds include:</p>
       <ul><li>feathers</li><li>bills</li><li>furcula</li><li>fused bones in pelvis, feet, hands, and head</li>
         <li>lightweight bones (bones that are either hollow or spongy/strutted)</li>
         <li>no teeth or maxillary bones of the jaw (reduces anterior weight)</li>
         <li>endothermic</li>
         <li>four-chambered heart and exhibit high metabolic rates</li>
         <li>produce large, richly provisioned external eggs</li>
         <li>remarkable navigational abilities in many species</li>
         <li>extraordinary communication and song production</li></ul>
     <h4 id="lowpa"><strong>Evolved from Dinosaurs</strong></h4>
       <p>In the 19th century, Thomas Henry Huxley analyzed the skeletons of dinosaurs and birds, concluding that the two groups were closely related. Bird feet have three toes, reptile-like scales, and a hind claw, like bipedal dinosaurs. 
         More recently Chris Organ, a molecular biologist at Harvard University, analyzed the proteins of a 68-million-year-old leg fossil from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The dinosaur proteins more closely resembled those from chickens than crocodiles 
         (Organ et al. 2008). Today, birds are believed to belong to a clade named Maniraptora, a branch of therapod dinosaurs. Therapods were bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. Some dinosaurs, even those not usually considered to be birds, had feathers. 
         In spite of the enormous influence birds have on us—as sources of food such as the chicken (Gallus gallus), as pest controllers (many birds are insectivorous and reduce insect populations that would destroy human crops), or as 
         plant pollinators—humans have decimated bird diversity. Over the past four centuries, over 100 cases of bird extinction have been documented. Human predation and habitat destruction, not to mention the introduction of invasive 
         species like dogs and rats, have been responsible for 90% of these. There is evidence that the Earth is currently undergoing an episode of mass extinction. Unlike the asteroid that probably caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 
         65 million years ago, the current mass extinction, that is destroying their descendants, has a different suspect.</p>
