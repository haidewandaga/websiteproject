     <h3>What is an <strong>Arthropods</strong>?</h3>
       <p>Antropoda</p>
       <p>The phylum Arthropoda is the largest and most varied in the animal kingdom. It includes well over one million described species. This represents 
         approximately three-quarters of all known biological organisms, living or extinct. Countless arthropods remain undescribed (not yet named and studied), 
         and the actual number of living species could be as high as ten million or more. Some of the more well-known arthropods include insects, crustaceans, and spiders, 
         as well as the fossil trilobites . Arthropods are found in virtually every known marine (ocean-based), freshwater, and terrestrial (land-based) ecosystem, and 
         vary tremendously in their habitats, life histories, and dietary preferences.</p>
     <h4 id="lowpa"><strong>Characteristics of Arthropods:</strong></h4>
       <p>Despite the remarkable variety of arthropod species, all share aspects of a single basic body plan. All arthropods possess a stiff exoskeleton (external skeleton)
         composed primarily of chitin . In some species, lipids, proteins, and calcium carbonate may also contribute to the exoskeleton. The external skeleton offers organisms
         protection as well as support for the body. Its walls provide anchors for the attachment of muscles. The exoskeleton is incapable of growth, and is molted (shed) 
         repeatedly during the growth of the animal. This process is called ecdysis. Molting allows for rapid growth until the newly secreted exoskeleton hardens.</p>
       <p>Arthropod bodies are divided into segments. However, a number of segments are sometimes fused to form integrated body parts known as tagmata. This process of 
         fusion is called tagmosis. The head, thorax, and abdomen are examples of tagmata. Arthropods also have appendages with joints (the word "arthropod" means "jointed feet").
         In early, primitive anthropods, each body segment was associated with a single pair of appendages (attachments). However, in most species some appendages have been modified
         to form other structures, such as mouthparts, antennae, or reproductive organs. Arthropod appendages may be either biramous (branched) or uniramous (unbranched).</p>
       <p>Some arthropods have highly developed sense organs. Most species have paired compound eyes , and many also have a number of simpler eyes called ocelli. Arthropods 
         have an open circulatory system (without blood vessels) that consists of a tube that is the heart and an open hemocoel , the coelom of the animal, in which blood pools.
         Arthropods also have a complete gut with two openings, the mouth and the anus.</p>
       <p>Gas exchange in the phylum occurs in various ways. Some species have gills, while others employ tracheae, or book lungs. The tracheal respiratory system consists
         of external openings called spiracles that are linked to a system of branched tubules which allow respiratory gases to reach internal tissues. Arthropods are
         characterized by a brain as well as a nerve ring around the area of the pharynx, in the oral cavity. A double nerve cord extends backwards along the ventral
         surface of the body, and each body segment is associated with its own ganglion, or mass of nerve cells. In most arthropod species, the sexes are separate. 
         Fertilization usually occurs internally, and most species are egg laying. While some species exhibit direct development, in which eggs hatch as miniature 
         versions of adults, other species pass through an immature larval stage and undergo a dramatic metamorphosis before reaching adult form.</p>
