		<h4>What is a <strong>Mammal</strong>?</h4>
          	 <p>Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (/məˈmeɪli.ə/ from Latin mamma "breast"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands.</p>
          	 <p>Mammals include the largest animals on the planet, the great whales, as well as some of the most intelligent, such as elephants, primates and cetaceans. The basic body type is a terrestrial quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.</p>
        	<h4 id="lowpa"><strong>Characteristics of a Mammal:</strong></h4>
		  <p>These characteristics are common to all mammals:</p><ul>
            		<li>Mammals nurse their babies. They feed them on the mother's milk. Mammals have to eat  a lot of food to maintain their high body temperature.</li>
            		<li>Most mammals give their young more protection and training than do other animals.</li>
            		<li>Only mammals have hair. All mammals have hair at some time in their life, though in certain whales it is present only before birth. </li>
            		<li> Mammals are warm-blooded. Their body temperature remains about the same all the time, even though the temperature of their surroundings may change. Birds are also warm-blooded, but animal groups such as fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians are not.</li>
           		<li>Mammals have a larger, more well-developed brain than do other animals. Some mammals, such as chimpanzees, dolphins, and especially human beings, are highly intelligent.</li>
            		<li>Mammals are able to move around using limbs.</li></ul>
      		<h4 id="lowpa"><strong>Definition:</strong></h4>
      		 <p>The word "mammal" is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma ("teat, pap"). In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals, the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes (echidnas and platypuses) and therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) and all descendants of that ancestor. Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic period, Rowe's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic, despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the Haramiyida have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century. If Mammalia is considered as the crown group, its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others. Ambondro is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while Amphilestes and Amphitherium are more closely related to the therians; as fossils of all three genera are dated about 167 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic, this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group.</p>			      
          	 <p>T. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition: "synapsids that possess a dentary–squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement" or, equivalently in Kemp's view, the clade originating with the last common ancestor of Sinoconodon and living mammals. The earliest known synapsid satisfying Kemp's definitions is Tikitherium, dated 225 Ma, so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date.</p>
